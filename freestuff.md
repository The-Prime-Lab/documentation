# The Big Book of Free Stuff

This is a list of free things you get as a CSCE student at UARK. Some of it is provided via the university, and some of it comes from student promos, but everything here is free and will help you develop your programming skills.

## Misc Student Programs

- [**Github Student Pack**](https://education.github.com/pack) - Github has a massive collection of free licenses, trials, services, domain names, and even cloud hosting credit. You even get a free Github pro subscription as long as your application is valid. This is far and away one of the easiest ways to get a ton of high quality services and tools for free.
