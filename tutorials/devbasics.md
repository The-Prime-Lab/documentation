# Development Basics

This is a list of guides, tutorials, customizations, and other tools you can use to improve your workflow. All recommendations here are subjective, and you may find something else that works better for you. This list is mainly to help new developers learn how to create an environment that is quick and easy for them to use.

## IDEs vs Editors

A text editor is simply a program that opens a text file and allows the user to edit it. An IDE (integrated development environment) contains extra tools that are specifically designed make writing code for a specific language easier. So, for example, a fresh install of VS Code or Notepad++ would be considered text editors, while Netbeans or Eclipse would be considered IDEs.

## [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

VS Code is a popular text editor that, with extensions, can be converted into an IDE suitable for almost any language. There are also many other genres of extensions that go beyond that to simply improve the environment such as themes or snippets.

### Themes

Themes are extensions that change the look and feel of the editor. These are usually just color swaps or icon packs.



### Snippets

Snippets are language or library specific plugins that give you a list of short phrases that autocomplete into large blocks of boilerplate code.



### Language Specific

These extensions add functionality that is usually associated with an IDE. VS code allows this by using the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).



### Misc. improvements

Some extensions that don't really fit into one category 



## [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

IntelliJ Idea is an IDE by JetBrains that is primarily used for JVM based languages such as Java and Kotlin. It also has support for a variety of other languages, and is what Android Studio is based on.
