# Equipment Status

This is a list of everything that is currently busted in the lab. If any of this looks out of date, or you find something that needs fixing, please contact one of the staff on Discord.

## 3D Printers

- Octoprint needs troubleshooting, it seems to be mangling gcode and generally being weird. For the time being, please print using the SD cards in the lab.
- The Lulzbot Mini is currently fully operational, but slicing needs to be done via SD card
- The part cooler fan on the Taz 6 is broken. Printing is still possible, but expect lots of stringing.
- The MMU2S doesn't work, and it has taken the Prusa MK3S down with it. The Prusa is currently out of the lab while we work on fixing it.
- We are currently pricing out new, high quality printers to phase out the current ones, stay tuned!

# VR

- None of the VR headsets will be in the lab until we are able to get proper cleaning equipment for it.

# Misc.

- The digital whiteboard sucks, we know. There is a new physical whiteboard in the lab, it should be getting installed fairly soon.
